# Make The Controller

1. A Song belongs to an Artist, add a select box to the songs form so that a user can add an Artist association to a Song.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!ASK BOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it's building new artists everytime we're saving a song instead of just associating that song's artist with an existing artist


      self.artist.build vs. self.build_artist


2. An Artist has many songs, without changing the artists form, change the artists controller so that many songs can be associated with an artist.
